# Escrow Payment Contract

## Project Description
The **Escrow Payment Contract** provides a decentralized way to handle transactions securely between a payer and a payee, with an arbiter acting as the mediator. The contract ensures that funds are only released once both parties agree, or refunded if conditions are not met.

## Project Vision
The vision is to eliminate the need for centralized intermediaries in transactions, thereby reducing fraud risk and increasing trust. By leveraging blockchain transparency, the contract ensures fairness for both buyers and sellers.

## Key Features
- Secure escrow deposit system for transactions.
- Arbiter-controlled release or refund of funds.
- Transparency with event logs for all actions.
- Viewable contract balance and escrow status.
- Supports initial deposit during deployment or later funding.

## Future Scope
- Multi-arbiter voting system for disputes.
- Integration with decentralized identity (DID) systems.
- Frontend dApp interface for non-technical users.
- Token-based escrow support (ERC20, stablecoins).
- Automated dispute resolution using smart contract logic.
